Brand Guidelines
================

Thanks for making an app that works with ours! This guide will help you brand your app so people don’t confuse your product with one of ours.


Naming your app
---------------

**Do**

* Name your app something unique.
* Include language on your site explaining that your app is built to work with Basecamp, Highrise, Backpack, or Campfire so people understand your product.

**Don't**

* Use words that are related to our apps — like “Base” or “Camp”.
* Use language to suggest that your app is official or endorsed by us.
